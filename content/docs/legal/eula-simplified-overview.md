title: "EULA Simplified Overview"
---

This quick summary helps you understand the main points of our EULA but is not legally binding. The full EULA always takes precedence if there's any conflict.

- **Freemium Model**: Core features are free. Advanced (premium) features require a paid product key.
- **Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use**: You can use Ocelot-Cloud freely for any non-commercial purpose. You can charge for installing and supporting Ocelot-Cloud on someone else’s hardware, but you **cannot** offer Ocelot-Cloud as a paid Software as a Service (SaaS) or bundle it as part of a paid service.
- **Prohibited Actions**: Don’t break security, distribute viruses, misrepresent content, or try to bypass license/feature restrictions.
- **User Responsibility**: You assume all risks when downloading or uploading content. If you host Ocelot-Cloud for others, you must comply with all relevant privacy laws.
- **Warranty & Liability**: Ocelot-Cloud is provided “as is,” with no warranties. We aren’t liable for damages caused by your use or misuse of Ocelot-Cloud or any third-party content.
- **App Store Content**: We don’t moderate user-uploaded content. Anything uploaded is automatically made available under the [0BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd), meaning it’s essentially public domain. Use of third party content is at your own risk.
