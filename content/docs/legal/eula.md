## 2. Additional Terms for the Cloud

### 2.1 License Grant
- You have a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual right to use and redistribute the unmodified Cloud for any purpose.
- You may install or self-host the Cloud for yourself or on behalf of third parties and allow any number of users to access it, provided that you do not charge any hosting or usage fees for the Cloud itself.
- You may charge a fee for professional services (e.g., installation, support, consulting) performed on the customer's own hardware or environment, but you may not operate the Cloud on your own hardware as a paid service for others.
- Non-commercial (free) SaaS usage is permitted, so long as no direct or indirect fees are charged to end users for access or usage. Any commercial, paid, or otherwise monetized SaaS or multi-tenant offering of the Cloud is strictly prohibited, including bundling the Cloud as part of a paid product or service.
- The above restriction does not prohibit developing or distributing third-party apps (including paid apps) through the App Store; only monetization of the Cloud itself as a service is disallowed.
- The Cloud is offered in Freemium and Premium modes. Freemium features are available without a product key. Premium features require a valid, non-transferable product key.

### 2.2 Restrictions
- Do not reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Cloud.
- Do not attempt to bypass or circumvent licensing mechanisms, feature restrictions, or product key validation.
- Do not distribute cracked or unauthorized copies.
- Do not share or transfer product keys to third parties.

### 2.3 Data Protection Compliance
You are responsible for complying with all applicable data protection laws when deploying or operating the Cloud. If you deploy the Cloud for third parties, you must ensure the deployment itself complies with relevant data protection and usage regulations, but the third party remains responsible for their own compliance. You remain fully responsible for your own or any third-party’s deployment, unless and until that third party independently assumes compliance obligations.

### 2.4 Termination
If your rights under this EULA are terminated, you must cease all use of the Cloud and destroy all copies in your possession or control. The provisions listed in Section 1.14 shall continue to apply even after termination.

### 2.5 Data Collection

Freemium Usage: We do not require personal data for Freemium features. We may provide an optional, opt-in mechanism for collecting anonymous usage statistics that contain no personal or identifying information.

Premium Usage: For Premium features, we collect only the minimal data needed to verify your license, which may include product keys, IP addresses, and device information. This data may be transmitted to our license server for periodic validation. We store it only for as long as required under applicable law (including GDPR) or to confirm compliance with this EULA.

### 2.6 Third-Party License Verification

For Premium features, we rely on a third-party service (the “License Provider”) to process and validate product keys, which may include collecting or transmitting your product key, IP address, or device information. By using the Premium features, you agree to any applicable terms and policies of the License Provider. The Maintainer is not responsible for the data-handling practices or services of the License Provider.

## 3. Additional Terms for the App Store

### 3.1 Use of the App Store
You may use the App Store for any lawful purpose. You remain bound by the Prohibited Activities in Section 1.2.

### 3.2 Uploader Responsibility
By uploading content, you confirm it is free of harmful code and licensed under the {{<external_link "https://opensource.org/license/0bsd" "0BSD License">}}. You must not upload content that instructs others to download or execute malicious applications. The Maintainer does not claim ownership of user-uploaded content.

### 3.3 Personal Data
We collect email addresses solely for account management, notifications, and to prevent bot account creation. We do not sell, share, or use it to train AI models. We implement reasonable measures to protect your data. You may access, correct, or delete your personal data through the App Store.

### 3.4 Termination
We may suspend or terminate your App Store account if you violate this EULA. You must discontinue use of the App Store immediately upon termination.

### 3.5 Additional Disclaimer for User-Uploaded Content
We do not guarantee the safety, reliability, or legality of user-uploaded content. You assume all risks associated with downloading, accessing, or using such content. The Maintainer does not monitor or review user-uploaded content for legality or compliance and assumes no responsibility for such content, but reserves the right to remove it at any time at their sole discretion.
