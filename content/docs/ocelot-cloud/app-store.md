This article explains the **App Store** page in the Ocelot-Cloud GUI. The actual {{< external_link "https://store.ocelot-cloud.org/" "App Store" >}} is a separate online server.

The App Store lets you browse, search and install web-based apps on your Ocelot Cloud instance with just a few clicks. You can search by maintainer or app name and install the latest version by default. You also have the option to select an older version.

{{< alert title="Note" color="warning" >}}
We only provide the App Store platform and do not moderate its content. Install apps only from trusted maintainers. The official trusted maintainer is **"ocelotcloud"**. Installing apps from unknown sources may compromise your server and data.
