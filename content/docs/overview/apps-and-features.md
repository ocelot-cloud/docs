### Ocelot-Cloud

The actual day-to-day functionality like chat or data cloud comes from the installed apps. Ocelot-Cloud takes care of the system administration in the background. Once an app is installed, Ocelot-Cloud takes care of:

* network configuration
* certificate management
* updates
* backups
* centralized user and access management
* user and network traffic monitoring
* centralized collection and visualization of metrics and logs
* sending notifications based on collected data

### App Store

Digital infrastructure can be installed as apps, much like a smartphone. An app store simplifies the process of discovering and installing new apps, while allowing anyone to upload their own apps - fostering a rapidly growing, open ecosystem.

## App Examples

These are just a few examples of commonly used apps. In fact, any software with a graphical web interface can be packaged as an app and integrated into the Ocelot-Cloud via the App Store.
