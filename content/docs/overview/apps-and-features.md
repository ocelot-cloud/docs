This section provides an overview of the features offered by the Ocelot-Cloud Platform, as well as the apps that extend its functionality for a wide range of use cases.

## Ocelot-Cloud Platform

### Easy Installation

Ocelot-Cloud can be installed on any device that supports a widely used technology called 'Docker,' making it largely independent of hardware and operating systems. All server maintenance tasks are handled automatically by Ocelot-Cloud in the background.

### App Store

Digital infrastructure can be installed as apps, much like a smartphone. An app store simplifies the process of discovering and installing new apps, while allowing anyone to upload their own apps - fostering a rapidly growing, open ecosystem.

### Automatic Maintenance

Once an app is installed, Ocelot-Cloud takes care of all the tedious maintenance tasks. This includes:
  * network configuration
  * creation and renewal of security certificates
  * updates
  * backups and recovery
  * centralization of user accounts
  * user access management
  * user and network traffic monitoring
  * centralized collection and visualization of metrics and logs
  * sending notifications based on collected data

## Apps

These are just a few examples of commonly used apps. In fact, any software with a graphical web interface can be packaged as an app and integrated into the Ocelot-Cloud via the App Store.
