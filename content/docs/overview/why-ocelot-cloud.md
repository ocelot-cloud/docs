title: "Why Ocelot-Cloud?"

Digital technology is deeply integrated into our personal and professional lives, helping us store and share data, chat, and videoconference. These conveniences rely on a robust digital infrastructure. While many solutions exist, none fully meet the common needs of many citizens and small-to-medium-sized organizations.

## Cloud Providers

You can pay a cloud provider to manage your data for you. You pay a fee, upload your data to a server managed by the provider, and you're done. The cloud provider handles all the technical details, such as updates and backups, offering convenience on a pay-as-you-go basis. However, there are risks involved:

* **Black Boxing**: Providers have complete control over the servers you use. They can spy on or steal your data without your knowledge. Even if the provider is trustworthy, governments and intelligence agencies can force them to monitor your behavior and share your data.
* **Vendor Lock-In**: Migrating your data to another vendor is very expensive. Systems are often incompatible, and years of data must be transferred. If a vendor changes terms, raises prices excessively, or provides poor service, you may have to perform costly migrations or accept unfavorable terms. If the vendor goes bankrupt, you're forced to migrate.
* **Lack of Customization**: Digital infrastructure often requires customization, which isn't possible because the server software is completely controlled by the cloud provider.

**Takeaway: To avoid this, we must host the digital infrastructure on our own hardware.**

## Self-Hosting
An alternative is self-hosting, where you build your digital infrastructure to keep your data under your control and avoid the risks mentioned above. But it requires extensive technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance, making it expensive and impractical for individuals and small organizations. We need software that seamlessly automates these tasks.

**Takeaway: We need infrastructure management software that makes setup and maintenance very easy.**

## Proprietary Self-Hosted Solutions

Some vendors offer self-hosted infrastructure management tools. You install their software on your server, specify the software you need, and the software handles everything else. However, these solutions are **proprietary software**, which leads to several issues:

* **Black Boxing and Vendor-Locking**: Proprietary software often has the same disadvantages as using a cloud provider. With proprietary software, the source code is usually hidden, so you can't see what the software does or how it works. This lack of transparency allows vendors to include hidden features that could spy on you or compromise your data. In addition, proprietary software is still controlled by the vendor, so you are subject to the vendor's terms and conditions, which can change at any time.
* **Lack of Customization**: Although the software can run on your own device, customization is still not possible as there is no access to the full source code.

**Takeaway: The solution software must be open source.**

## Ocelot Cloud

For all of the above reasons, the Ocelot-Cloud was created. It's a self-hosted, easy-to-use, open source infrastructure management platform designed to deliver customizable digital solutions. By self-hosting with Ocelot Cloud, you not only increase the security of your data, but also significantly reduce costs compared to traditional cloud provider fees.
