title: "Ethical Guidelines"
---

Our mission is to create a self-hosting, open source solution that provides users with a privacy-oriented alternative to mainstream cloud providers, enabling them to install and maintain secure digital infrastructure. The following policies outline our beliefs.

## Data Sovereignty

* The user has full control over their data. We only store personal information when necessary for core functionality, such as payment processing. Users will never need to create an account to use open-source products.
* Collection of user information that is not technically required will never be forced. We may ask the user to provide the data voluntarily as it is helpful feedback, but there is always the option to decline without repercussions. If the user consents, such collected data will be strictly anonymized, i.e. no personal information will be stored.
* We will never sell users' personal information to third parties or use it to train AI.
Users are always informed about what data is being collected, if any.
* We strongly oppose legislation that unjustifiably invades users' privacy. This includes [data retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention) laws that force companies to monitor citizens on the basis of broad suspicion. We are developing Ocelot-Cloud to promote self-hosted infrastructure as a way to empower users to reduce such data collection enforcement.
* We do not patronize our users, although we encourage self-hosting and preferably open source apps, they are free to host Ocelot-Cloud on external servers and install proprietary apps.

## Ethical Business

* We maintain our non-profit company form and integrity by never accepting private capital investment. Profits are reinvested to improve the open source ecosystem.
* Ethics before business. We only engage in activities that are consistent with our ethical standards. At the same time, we recognize that business awareness supports financial sustainability. This enables us to generate revenue that increases our impact in advancing open source.
* We will never include spyware, backdoors, or other malicious features in our software.
* We reject unethical business practices such as price gouging, deceptive marketing, or feature crippling. The latter means that we never make open source products worse, in order to force users to buy the commercial edition.
