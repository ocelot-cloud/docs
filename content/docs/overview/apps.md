### Ocelot-Cloud

Ocelot-Cloud only takes care of the system administration. The actual day-to-day functionality like chat or data cloud comes from the installed apps.

### App Store

Digital infrastructure can be installed as apps, much like a smartphone. An app store simplifies the process of discovering and installing new apps, while allowing anyone to upload their own apps - fostering a rapidly growing, open ecosystem.

## App Examples

These are just a few examples of commonly used apps. In fact, any software with a graphical web interface can be packaged as an app and integrated into the Ocelot-Cloud via the App Store.
