At Ocelot-Cloud, we are driven by a strong commitment to digital sovereignty, ethics, and usability for technically less experienced users. We started out trying to run our own digital infrastructure, but found the complexity challenging and existing solutions either too limited or too expensive. This challenge inspired us to create a tool that gives individuals and small businesses full control over their data without sacrificing convenience. We want to do good by providing essential features for free, giving everyone the option of cloud provider independence and complete control over their digital infrastructure.
