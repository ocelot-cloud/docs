I am a programmer with a strong interest in privacy, ethics, and digital sovereignty. I have never wanted to use cloud providers to handle my data because they can easily spy on me and steal all my data without me noticing. And digital infrastructure provided by proprietary products was never an option for me for the same reasons.

So I decided to host my personal open source digital infrastructure at home, but the complexity of doing everything from scratch became a real challenge. So I looked for alternatives, a self-hosting management tool, but found that existing open source solutions fell short. I became passionate about finding ways to maintain control over my data without sacrificing convenience. This led me to the idea of writing my own open source software to automate the tedious aspects of self-hosting and make it accessible to everyone.

Ocelot-Cloud was born from this vision to solve the problem of self-hosting for citizens and small or medium sized businesses. For now, I intend to finish the first open source production release and build a community around the project.
