At Ocelot-Cloud, we are driven by a strong commitment to digital sovereignty, ethics, and usability for less tech-savvy users. We set out to run our own digital infrastructure, but found the complexity daunting and existing solutions either too limited or too expensive. This challenge inspired us to build a tool that gives individuals and small businesses full control over their data without sacrificing convenience. We do good by offering essential features for free, helping everyone gain independence from cloud providers and maintain complete control over their digital infrastructure.
