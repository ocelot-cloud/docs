I am a programmer with a strong interest in privacy, ethics, and digital sovereignty. I always wanted to host my own digital infrastructure for maximum privacy. But the complexity of doing everything from scratch became a real challenge. So I looked for alternatives, but found that existing infrastructure management solutions were insufficient or expensive. I became passionate about finding ways to maintain control over my data without sacrificing convenience. This led me to the idea of writing my own software to automate the tedious aspects of self-hosting and make it accessible to everyone.

Ocelot-Cloud was born from this vision to provide an easy-to-use digital infrastructure management platform for citizens and small or medium sized businesses.
