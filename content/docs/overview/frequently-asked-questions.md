### What is Ocelot-Cloud?

Ocelot-Cloud is a self-hosted, open-source infrastructure management platform that allows you to set up and maintain your own secure digital infrastructure. It automates tasks like installing apps, backups, and updates, making self-hosting accessible without requiring extensive technical expertise.

### Who is Ocelot-Cloud for?

Ocelot-Cloud is designed for individuals and small to medium-sized organizations that want control over their digital infrastructure without relying on external cloud providers. It's ideal for those who value privacy, customization, and long-term sustainability.

### What does self-hosted mean?

Self-hosted means you run the software on your own hardware, giving you full control over your data and infrastructure. This contrasts with external hosting, where your data and apps are managed by third-party providers, exposing you to risks like unauthorized data access and vendor lock-in.

### What is open source, and why is it important?

Open source software provides access to publicly available source code that can be inspected, modified, and enhanced. This transparency ensures functionality without hidden risks such as malicious code, fosters community collaboration, and strengthens security through peer review. Beyond access to the source code, it grants four fundamental freedoms: to use, study, modify, and redistribute the software, empowering users and preventing vendor lock-in.

### Is Ocelot-Cloud secure?

Practically, yes. Security is a top priority for Ocelot-Cloud, and we've built in extensive protections, including robust cryptographic algorithms, app isolation, and regular security testing. While we prioritize minimizing risk through a security-by-design approach, it's technically impossible to achieve 100% security, and no system is completely immune. We remain committed to ongoing efforts to keep our platform as secure as possible.

### Can the developers of Ocelot-Cloud access or steal my data?

No. Ocelot-Cloud is open source software that you run on your own hardware, ensuring that your data remains under your control and inaccessible to us. The transparency of open source code allows the community to inspect and verify the software, making it likely that any attempt to introduce malicious code would be quickly detected. We are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards, so introducing malicious code would not only violate our principles, but also undermine the trust and reputation we have built within the community.

### What is the Anti-Surveillance Policy?

Our Anti-Surveillance Policy means we refuse to spy on our users in any way. Your data belongs to you alone. We may request anonymous usage data to improve our software, but only with your explicit consent. No personal information is collected without necessity.

### How does Ocelot-Cloud compare to Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is an app focused on file storage and collaboration. Ocelot-Cloud, on the other hand, is a generic platform that allows you to install and manage multiple apps, including Nextcloud, but also many others. Ocelot-Cloud also handles administrative tasks such as updates, backups and more, making it much more versatile and powerful than a standalone Nextcloud.

### How does Ocelot-Cloud compare to traditional cloud providers?

By hosting your own cloud with Ocelot-Cloud, you eliminate the need to trust external providers with your data. This reduces risks of unauthorized access, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. You have full control over your data and can customize your infrastructure to meet your specific needs without worrying about changing terms or excessive fees.

### How does Ocelot-Cloud compare to Proton?

[Proton](https://proton.me/) offers services that allow users to upload data to its servers in an end-to-end encrypted form, ensuring that only the user, not even Proton, can access the content. Proton provides open source client software that transparently manages the encryption and uploading process. While this approach offers greater privacy than traditional cloud providers, it has certain limitations compared to self-hosting:
* **Metadata Collection**: Proton can still collect metadata about user activity, such as timestamps, IP addresses, and interaction patterns, which can provide insight into usage even when content remains private.
* **Legal Compliance**: Proton is subject to the laws of the country in which it operates (Switzerland). If a government requests collected data or imposes certain regulations, such as monitoring your activity, Proton must comply, even if they don't want to, which could compromise user privacy.
* **Internet Exposure**: Proton's servers are accessible via the Internet, creating potential attack vectors. In contrast, self-hosted infrastructure can be installed in a private network, reducing exposure to Internet-based threats.
* **Limited Customization**: Because Proton manages its own servers, users cannot customize the infrastructure or integrate additional apps. Self-hosting provides full control over software, configurations, and custom integrations.
* **Vendor Lock-In**: Users are subject to Proton's pricing and policies, as the company maintains full control over its servers. A potentially costly data migration may be required if their terms become unfavorable.

### What hardware do I need to run Ocelot-Cloud?

Ocelot-Cloud is designed to be resource efficient, so it can run on minimal hardware. The actual hardware requirements depend on the apps you install. To determine the right hardware, check the CPU, memory, and disk space requirements of each app. If you're unsure, choose a system with more resources. For environments with limited hardware, you can explicitly choose hardware-efficient apps that allow the Ocelot-Cloud infrastructure to run on low-end devices.

### Which company form will Ocelot-Cloud have?

We plan to establish Ocelot-Cloud as a non-profit organization. This structure ensures we remain committed to open-source principles and ethical business practices, prioritizing user interests and long-term sustainability over profit.

### As a cloud provider, can I make money through Ocelot-Cloud as SaaS?

Yes. We actively encourage cloud providers to do so . Cloud providers are part of the solution. crucial part of the  ecosystem. The communicty edition is pen source, which allows free hosting anyway. But also the Enterprise edition will be distributed under license terms, allowing free hosting without any extra cost or beurocracy.

### Can I host Ocelot Cloud for others?

Yes. The goal is to make Ocelot-Cloud as easily and widely available as possible. Cloud providers are an important part of the Ocelot-Cloud ecosystem and are encouraged to integrate Ocelot-Cloud into their service offerings. They can benefit financially by hosting and selling access to the platform, thus helping to spread the software. The Community Edition is free to host anyway due to its open source licence. The proprietary Enterprise Edition is also free to host under the terms of the licence, with no additional fees or bureaucracy. Ocelot Cloud can also be hosted privately for friends, organisations, local clubs or schools without any restrictions.
