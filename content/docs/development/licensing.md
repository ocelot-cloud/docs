The following strategies are driven by our desire to:
* Promote the open source ecosystem
* Build a financially sustainable business model
* Adhere to ethical business practices

We have a reasonable fear that a competitor with superior resources could take our code, build a proprietary edition, out-compete us, and turn the project into a proprietary one. This is a common strategy in the software industry known as [Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace%2C_extend%2C_and_extinguish). We want to avoid this scenario, at least initially, to ensure that the project remains ethical.

To achieve this, we take an initial approach with more control over the software, starting with proprietary code and later moving to an open core model. There may be an intermediate model with an [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) license and a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) that is open source and prevents proprietary competing products. However, since CLAs are understandably unpopular with contributors since they have to deal with legal documents, in the long run, when business stabilizes, we want to move to a permissive license like [0BSD](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd) without the need for a CLA.
