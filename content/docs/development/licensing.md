Summary: We start with [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), and later, when we reach a certain size, we move to a permissive license like [0BSD](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd).

### Why use AGPL + CLA?

The Ocelot-Cloud Community Edition is open source. But using a permissive open source license for it, such as the MIT license, would allow other companies to take the code, build commercial products from it, and profit from our and the community’s efforts without any obligation to contribute money or code in return. This would also undermine our ability to generate revenue. Therefore, we chose AGPL along with a CLA to retain the exclusive right to create a commercial proprietary Premium Edition of Ocelot-Cloud, ensuring that revenues are reinvested in the development of both the Community and Premium Editions. It also gives us time to implement the premium edition without rushing, and to remain independent of private investment that would turn this project into a profit-making venture instead of its originally intended focus on the public good.

How does this work? The AGPL license requires that any derivative product also be licensed under the AGPL to ensure that it remains open source. This mechanism is called “copyleft”. This rule ensures that only open source editions of Ocelot-Cloud will exist. However, if we own the source code, either by writing it ourselves or by legal license grant, we have the option to release it under a different license. We can offer both an open source Community Edition and a proprietary Premium Edition with additional features that generate revenue to fund the project.

### Why is the CLA Important?

When you contribute to Ocelot-Cloud, you retain ownership of your code. Since it is licensed under the AGPL, this prevents us from relicensing your code. To allow us to dual-license and to ensure the financial sustainability of the project, we ask you to sign a CLA. This allows us to relicense and offer both an open source Community Edition and a proprietary Premium Edition. The Community Edition and your contributions will remain open source and can be used as such and forked at any time. We believe this approach strikes a fair balance between community and business interests.

What does that mean for me as a user of Ocelot-Cloud?
If you use Ocelot-Cloud without modifying the code, you can use it like any other open source software. However, if you do modify the source code, your modifications must also be licensed under the AGPL, and you must make the source code available to all users of the modified version. If you are the only user of a modified version, you do not need to do anything. Otherwise, we recommend that you contribute your changes to this GitHub repository so that everyone can benefit from your efforts.

What does that mean for me as contributor of Ocelot-Cloud?
All contributors are required to read the Ocelot-Cloud Contributor License Agreement and sign it by copying and renaming the CLA Signing Template to legal/contributors/<your-github-name>.md. Fill out the newly created signing template and submit it as part of your contribution. The CLA signing will automatically apply to all subsequent contributions, so it only needs to be done once for the first contribution. There is also a sample file of what your CLA signing should look like in the end.
