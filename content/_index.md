Currently Ocelot Cloud is closed source and proprietary. This is to protect against competition during the cumbersome start-up phase and to reach the financial break-even point as soon as possible. After that, large parts of the project will become open source. The final business model is likely to be an open core, with all essential features available as open source in a community edition, while some advanced features will be available in a premium edition. The open source statements on this website are intended as a preview of the upcoming open source project.
